### Project Report: Airline Delay Causes Analysis and Prediction

#### Introduction
Airline delays are a common issue faced by travelers and airlines alike. Understanding the causes of these delays and being able to predict them can significantly enhance operational efficiency and improve passenger satisfaction. This project aims to analyze a dataset containing information about various causes of airline delays and build a predictive model to forecast future delays based on historical data. The dataset includes variables such as carrier delay, weather delay, NAS delay, security delay, and late aircraft delay among others.

#### Data Loading and Preprocessing
The dataset was loaded and inspected for missing values, which were then filled with zeroes to ensure completeness. Feature engineering was performed by summing up the different delay causes into a new feature called total_delay_causes. Additionally, categorical variables such as carrier and airport were converted into dummy variables for model compatibility.

#### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Visualizations were used to understand the distribution and relationships within the data:
1. *Distribution of Delays*: Histograms and boxplots were used to visualize the distribution of different types of delays.
2. *Monthly Trends*: Line plots showed the trends in delays over different months.
3. *Scatter Plot of Predicted vs Actual Delays*: This helped in understanding the model's performance visually.

#### Model Building
A RandomForestRegressor was chosen for its robustness and ability to handle complex datasets. The data was split into training and testing sets, with 5% of the data used for training to manage memory constraints. The model was trained on the training set and predictions were made on the test set.

#### Model Evaluation
The model's performance was evaluated using the following metrics:
- *Mean Absolute Error (MAE)*: 6.068
- *Mean Squared Error (MSE)*: 224601.35
- *R² Score*: 0.9986

These metrics indicate that the model performs exceptionally well, with a very high R² score suggesting that it explains almost all the variance in the delay data.

#### Conclusion
This project successfully analyzed and predicted airline delays using a RandomForestRegressor model. The model achieved an impressive R² score, indicating its effectiveness in explaining the variance in delay data. The results suggest that the model can be reliably used for predicting airline delays, potentially aiding in better resource allocation and improved passenger satisfaction.
